\subsection{Architecture overview}

\begin{frame}\frametitle{Architecture Overview} 
  \textbf{Design architecture for robots that:}
  \begin{itemize}
  \item Use \textcolor{red}{qualitative} and
    \textcolor{red}{quantitative} descriptions of incomplete knowledge
    to improve quality and efficiency of decision making.\\
    \textcolor{blue}{``books are usually in
the library''}\\
    \textcolor{blue}{``I am $90\%$ certain the book is on the
      table''}

    \ \\
   \item Work in complex dynamic domain where unexpected things happen.

    \ \\
    \item Receive more sensor data than it can handle at reasoning level. 

 % \item Always reasoning about observations related to the \textcolor{red}{uderlying intention} enabaling it to persue this intention in dynamics domains.\\
  %  \textcolor{blue}{``Mi intention is to put all books in the libary. Can my current plan still achieve so?''}
  %\item Reasons with \textcolor{red}{tightly-coupled} transition diagrams at two different levels of abstraction.

  \begin{itemize}
  \item Combine strengths of declarative programming and probabilistic
    models.
    
    \ \\
  \item \textcolor{red}{Formal relationship} between transition
    diagrams. \textcolor{blue}{Tight coupling, not a ``switch''}.

  \item Support \textcolor{red}{non-monotonic logic} and

    \textcolor{red}{incomplete domain knowledge} and
    \textcolor{red}{uncertainty}.

    \ \\
  \item \textcolor{red}{Interactive} and cumulative
    \textcolor{red}{relational learning}; classical and reinforcement,
    procedural and knowledge-based.

  \item Robot \textcolor{red}{assistant} moving objects to specific
    places.
  \item \textcolor{red}{Sorts}: $robot$, $place$, $object$, $entity$,
    $book$ etc; hierarchical arrangement.

  \item Instances, e.g., \textcolor{red}{place} = $\{of\!\!fice, kitchen,
    library\}$ or $\{red\_area, green\_area, yellow\_area\}$ for tabletop manipulatior.
  \end{itemize}

\frametitle{Illustrative Domain: Robot Moving Objects}

Let us assume that the robot is in the $kitchen$ and its goal is to put the two books in the $library$.
  \begin{center}
    \includegraphics[height=3em]{Images/fourrooms2}\hspace{2em} 
  \end{center}

In traditional planning the robot would:

    \begin{itemize}
    \item Create a plan as a sequence of actions, taking into consideration current beliefs and goal.
    \item Execute the actions of the sequence until one action does not have the expected output.
    \item Replan if necessary.

    \end{itemize}

\end{frame}




\begin{frame}
\frametitle{Illustrative Domain: Robot Moving Objects}
  \begin{center}
    \includegraphics[height=3em]{Images/fourrooms2}\hspace{2em} 
  \end{center}
In a dynamic domain we can have different scenarios:
    \begin{itemize}
    \item While the robot is moving the first book, the second book is moved to the library (\textcolor{red}{unexpected success}).
    \item While to robot is moving the first book, the second book is moved to office\ 1 (\textcolor{red}{not expected to achieve goal - case 1}).
    \item While to robot is moving the first book, the second book is moved to the kitchen (\textcolor{red}{not expected to achieve goal - case 2}).
    \item The robot moves the first book in the library, and when he is putting down the second book, 
the first book is being moved to another room(\textcolor{red}{failure to achieve the goal}).
