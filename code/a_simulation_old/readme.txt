This is a folder that contains all the files used for the simmulations of the two reasoning agents, one that plans with theory of intenion and one that plans without it.


Each reasoning agent is composed by three programs. 1- Controller, 2- Executer and 3- Knowledge Reprentation related files. 

For traditional reasoning agent those files are:
1. controllerTraditionalPlanning.py
2. executer.py
3. preASP_Domain.txt (used for diagnosis) and preASP_Traditional.txt (used for planning).

For intentional reasoing agent those files are:
1. controllreToI.py
2. executer.py
3. preASP_ToI.txt (used for both, diagnosis and planning).

The simulation of the agent interacting with the world will use 1- the programs related for the reasoning agent and 2- realWorld.py
