I have added two parameters to the controllers:
  1. a DomainInfo objects that is in charge to deal with the info and formatting of the domain_info
  2. a string that contains the name of the subfolder where the code for the executer will be

Within the subfolder where you will put your code, you will need to create two more subfolders, one called ASP_files,
and a second one called pre_ASP_files. The controllers will look for the pre_ASP files and store the
.sp files in the relevant subfolders.
